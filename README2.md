# README2

## About

This file contains extra information about this repository.

It has been split from the main README so that the test output will be more easily visible there.

## Alternatives

[Babelmark 2](http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/) is a project by @jgm to achieve a similar goal as this project, but by using a client server model where implementors maintain the client. The advantage is of course that it passes the weight of installation procedures to the implementors. The disadvantage is that it becomes harder to know what exact commands clients are using, and an evil implementor could easily cheat the system.

## History

The initial version of this project was extracted from <https://github.com/karlcow/markdown-testsuite> after CommonMark left stealth mode and killed it. The initial Markdown Test Suite code and the extraction were done by @cirosantilli.
